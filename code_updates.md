# Code Updates and Fixes
This is the updated code I've came up with while doing App Academy Online's MERN TWitter Project at the end of their MERN Stack curriculum. 

## Essential Updates
- x Add config.keys
- x Add passport.js / jwt util file that wasn't present before
- x Update Users reference string
    - https://open.appacademy.io/learn/full-stack-online/mern-stack-curriculum/mongoose-models
- x Update React 

## Mongo Atlas
- x Cluster0 name requirement in URI

## Setup Instructions
- Making sure to run front-end install

## React-Hook / Redux-Hooks
Maybe you should make this an alternative branch. 

- General Components
- Getting of Containers
- Login Form

## React 
- Clean up state code

## Unsorted
- bodyparse import priority 
- Mongoose populate implementation
- Do we need a new tweet entitity in the schema?
    - https://open.appacademy.io/learn/full-stack-online/mern-stack-curriculum/frontend-tweets
- Seeding demonstration


### Core
1.) Back-End installation issues
- npm run server, no `config` files with keys.js and passport.js
    - `config` is actually .gitignored. propose qol change then
    - `passport.js` catches users reference change early 

2.) Front-end installation issues

# QOL
- config file templates
- seeding 
- mongolab updated name
- Redux Dev Tools integration example
- How to debug
